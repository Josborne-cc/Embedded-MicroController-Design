# Embedded-MicroController-Design

This project involved the design of a microcontroller board revovling around the HCS12 processor.  After the design was complete software was written to control each of the different modules. 

SchematicPrints.pdf this is a file that includes the schematics for the board itself.

The main in this file is designed to parse commands from a linux pc and distribute commands to the modules.

The remainder of the files are the nessesary functions for controlling each of the modules on the board.
